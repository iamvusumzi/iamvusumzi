# Hi, I’m Vusumzi 👋

I’m a Software Engineer with experience building critical-mission distributed systems, automation tools, and full-stack applications.

Previously at **Amazon Development Centre (Cape Town)**, I worked on internal AWS tooling focused on:
- infrastructure visibility
- automation and reliability
- self-service control planes for customers

I enjoy working on problems involving:
- system design
- asynchronous processing
- backend services and APIs
- configuration-driven platforms
- cloud-native architectures
- control planes

## 🔧 Tech I Work With

**Backend:** Java (Spring Boot), Python (Flask), Ruby on Rails  
**Frontend:** React, TypeScript  
**Cloud:** AWS Lambda, SQS, S3, CloudFront  
**Data:** PostgreSQL
